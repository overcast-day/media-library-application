# Computer Science 210 Personal Project 2021

## A Media Library Application 

This application is intended to allow users to browse, sort and keep track of
all the media, books and reading material in the collection.

_________________

Users can *(will be able to)*:
- Browse current titles in the catalogue
- Add new titles to the catalogue
- Add and or edit the genre of existing titles
- Discover new and old stories by title and genre
- Add and remove the best stories into their 'Favorites' *(TBA)*

_________________
*Anyone* can use the application, **particularly** if you love reading and keeping track of 
your reading list.

I am making this project for myself, as I always found myself struggling to 
remember and stay on top of the numerous books and ongoing series I've read or stopped reading.

 >“A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies; The man who never reads lives only one.”
― George R.R. Martin, A Dance with Dragons

## Phase 4: Task 3
If I had more time, I would...
- create an Genre Enum class instead of having to rely on and parse the user's input in Books
- create a supertype or abstract class Media that has most methods that is currently contained in Books so I could
extend it to other media types that libraries usually have such as Comics and DvDs and Audiobooks
- Create a Library class that contains a list of all catalogues, so users can have the option of creating 
their own catalogue and are not just limited to 'Library' and 'Favorites'.
